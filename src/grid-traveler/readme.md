Grid Traveler Problem
--------------------

This module calculates the number of ways to travel on a grid from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, moving only down or right. Uses memoization for efficiency.

- `index.js`: Contains the implementation (function: gridTravelerMemo).
- `notes/`: Add your notes, images, or blog content here.

Usage:
Call `gridTravelerMemo(rows, cols)` to get the number of ways to travel the grid.
