# Dynamic Programming Problems

This project contains classic dynamic programming problems implemented in JavaScript. It is designed for learning, practicing, and demonstrating dynamic programming techniques.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains all problem implementations
    - `grid-traveler-problem.js` - Grid Traveler problem
    - `nth-fib-problem.js` - Nth Fibonacci problem
- `index.html` - Project homepage with links and information

## Problems Included

### Grid Traveler Problem
Calculates the number of ways to travel on a grid from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, moving only down or right.

### Nth Fibonacci Problem
Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
2. Explore the `src/` folder for problem implementations.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser for a project overview.
